                        MMK Make Utility for OpenVMS
                        ============================

MMK is a "make" utility for VMS systems.  It is used for building software
systems based on a "description file" (or "makefile") you create that lists
the sources and objects of a system and the dependencies between them.

MMK is similar in functionality to Digital's DEC/Module Management System (MMS),
and understands a syntax in its description files which is mostly compatible
with MMS (at least, older versions of MMS).  It also includes support for
creating inference rules that separate source and target directories, the
syntax for which was borrowed from NMAKE.

MMK runs on VAX/VMS, OpenVMS VAX, OpenVMS AXP, and OpenVMS IA64 systems.
It should build and run on versions of VMS older than V7.0, but is only
being maintained for more recent versions of the operating system.  MMK
has support for the DEC/CMS code management system, but does not require
it.
